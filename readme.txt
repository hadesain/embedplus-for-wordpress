EmbedPlus: YouTube for WordPress enhances the playback and visitor engagement of the YouTube videos you embed on your blogs.

== Description ==

Enhance the YouTube videos you embed in your WordPress blog using [EmbedPlus](http://www.embedplus.com). It not only provides the features of YouTube's standard embed, but also extra playback options, relevant user-generated content, and video reactions from communities like Digg and Reddit. Use it to **automatically** enhance the viewer experience and engagement around the YouTube videos you embed, for **free**. 

Here's a list of what it specifically adds: 

* Video Reactions (currently from Digg, Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter)
* Timed-Text Annotations
* Chaptering (custom and social)
* Cropping (set start *and stop times*)
* Instant Replay
* Looping
* Slow Motion
* Movable Zoom

...All without having to alter original video content. Please see our [home page](http://embedplus.com) demo to try some of these features. If you like them, come back here to download the WordPress plugin so that your visitors also see them in your existing and future embeds -- even if you use the the nifty [oEmbed method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) for YouTube.

Finally, we love to share EmbedPlus. If you are a plugin developer and wish to integrate these extra YouTube features with your own plugin, [contact us](http://www.embedplus.com/aboutcontact.aspx).

**Note: If you don't see the extra features on your YouTube embeds, you might have another YouTube-WordPress plugin that needs to be deactivated first.**

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin using the plugin installer within WordPress (or, upload the `embedplus-for-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. YouTube links on their own line will automatically be upgraded into EmbedPlus videos.
1. You can also now begin pasting EmbedPlus shortcodes within your WordPress editor. These shortcodes encapsulate customizations that you might wish to make. A new button in your post editor will appear that will start a wizard to guide you through making these customizations and getting the shortcode (see Screenshots).
1. View plugin settings under Settings > EmbedPlus.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of a YouTube link that will automatically be upgraded to an EmbedPlus embed (note that it is on its own line). If you don't see the extra features on your YouTube embeds, you might have another YouTube-WordPress plugin that needs to be deactivated first.
