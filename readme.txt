An advanced WordPress plugin for YouTube embeds. Its smart features enhance the playback and engagement of the YouTube videos you embed in your blogs.

== Description ==

Enhance the videos you embed in your WordPress blog using this feature-rich and smart YouTube plugin. It not only provides the features of YouTube's standard embed, but also extra playback options, relevant user-generated content, and video reactions beyond YouTube.com comments (e.g., Google+ and Reddit). Use it to **automatically** enhance the viewer experience and engagement around the YouTube videos you embed, for **free**. 

Install the plugin and you and your visitors immediately see the following features for each YouTube video:

* Video Reactions - Discussions around a YouTube video you embed might be happening all over the web, not just YouTube.com. This feature allows your visitors to read them right from your blog. We have a growing list of communities that includes Digg, Google+, Reddit, and Twitter. Recent YouTube.com comments are also displayed.
* Timed Annotations - Now you can add annotations to a YouTube embed even if you don't own the YouTube channel.  Use it to display captions, links, calls-to-action, etc at a specific time during playback. 
* Chaptering (custom and smart social chaptering)
* Cropping - Set start *and stop* times to share just a funny or interesting part of a YouTube video.
* Instant Replay
* Looping - Repeat a scene you like or the whole video over and over.
* Other DVD-like controls

...All without having to alter original video content. Please see the YouTube embed on our [home page](http://embedplus.com) demo to try some of these features. If you like them, come back here to download the WordPress plugin so that your visitors also see them in your existing and future embeds -- even if you use the nifty [oEmbed method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) of just pasting a YouTube video link on its own line.

Finally, we love to share EmbedPlus. If you are a plugin developer and wish to integrate these extra YouTube features with your own plugin, [contact us](http://www.embedplus.com/aboutcontact.aspx). Contact us if you have new smart features you'd like us to incorporate.

**Note: If you don't see the extra features on your YouTube embeds, you might have another YouTube-WordPress plugin that needs to be deactivated first.**

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin using the plugin installer within WordPress (or, upload the `embedplus-for-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. YouTube links on their own line will automatically be upgraded into EmbedPlus videos.
1. You can also now begin pasting EmbedPlus shortcodes within your WordPress editor. These shortcodes encapsulate customizations that you might wish to make. A new button in your post editor will appear that will start a wizard to guide you through making these customizations and getting the shortcode (see Screenshots).
1. View plugin settings under Settings > EmbedPlus.
1. **Note: If you don't see the extra features on your YouTube embeds, you might have another YouTube-WordPress plugin that needs to be deactivated first.**

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of a YouTube link that will automatically be upgraded to an EmbedPlus embed (note that it is on its own line). If you don't see the extra features on your YouTube embeds, you might have another YouTube-WordPress plugin that needs to be deactivated first.
2. If you want to customize an embed with extras like your own annotations, calls-to-action, and chapters, just click on the EmbedPlus editor button highlighted above. It will start a wizard within your blog to generate shortcode that captures the customizations.  You can then simply paste the code into your blog as shown above. 
3. An example of your enhanced video.
4. EmbedPlus can make your embeds more social.  Here are example reactions for the Avengers movie trailer - shown right from your blog.
5. A screenshot leading to Reddit reactions for the popular Avengers Movie Trailer.
6. An example unobtrusive annotation, that you can add to any video.
7. Here's another annotation example. It shows that you can add your own links to a video. This one is a call-to-action that links to our MailChimp list signup.
8. Here's the plugin executing the optional Sweet Spot Marking algorithm to create automatic "social chapters."
