EmbedPlus for WordPress enhances the playback and visitor engagement of the YouTube videos you embed on your blogs.

== Description ==

Embed YouTube videos in your WordPress blog using [EmbedPlus](http://www.embedplus.com). It not only provides the features of YouTube's standard embed but also enhanced playback and relevant content. Use it to enhance the viewer experiences and discussions around the YouTube videos you embed, for free. Just take a look at our home page demo [here](http://www.embedplus.com).

Also, if you're using the nifty [oEmbed method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) to embed videos, this plugin will also upgrade standard YouTube embed links into EmbedPlus embeds (take a look at the screenshots). All you need to do is put the YouTube link on its own line.

With EmbedPlus, you can upgrade your embeds with: 

* Scene Skipping
* Real-time Reactions
* Slow Motion On-Demand
* Video Cropping
* Movable Zoom
* Instant Replay
* Third Party Annotations

...All without having to alter original video content. Please see our [home page](http://embedplus.com) for more information.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin using the plugin installer within WordPress (or, upload `embedplus.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/embedplus-for-wordpress` directory)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. You can now begin pasting EmbedPlus shortcodes within your WordPress editor. The wizard at [EmbedPlus.com](http://www.embedplus.com) will guide you through getting this code for your video(s).
1. YouTube links on their own line will automatically be upgraded into EmbedPlus videos.
1. View plugin settings under Settings > EmbedPlus.

== Screenshots ==
