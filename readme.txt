EmbedPlus for WordPress enhances the playback and visitor engagement of the YouTube videos you embed on your blogs.

== Description ==

Enhance the YouTube videos you embed in your WordPress blog using [EmbedPlus](http://www.embedplus.com). It not only provides the features of YouTube's standard embed, but also extra playback options and relevant user-generated content.  Use it to **automatically** enhance the viewer experience and engagement around the YouTube videos you embed, for **free**. Just take a look at our home page demo [here](http://www.embedplus.com).

Also, if you're using the nifty [oEmbed method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) to embed videos, this plugin will also upgrade standard YouTube embed links into EmbedPlus embeds (take a look at the screenshots). All you need to do is put the YouTube link on its own line.

With EmbedPlus, you can upgrade your embeds with: 

* Custom Chapters for Scene Skipping 
* Web Viewer Reactions 
* Timed Annotations
* Instant Replay
* Scene/Video Looping
* Video Cropping
* Slow Motion On-Demand
* Movable Zoom

...All without having to alter original video content. Please see our [home page](http://embedplus.com) for more information.

We love to share EmbedPlus.  If you are a plugin developer and wish to integrate these extra YouTube features with your own plugin, [contact us](http://www.embedplus.com/aboutcontact.aspx).

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin using the plugin installer within WordPress (or, upload `embedplus.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/embedplus-for-wordpress` directory)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. YouTube links on their own line will automatically be upgraded into EmbedPlus videos.
1. You can also now begin pasting EmbedPlus shortcodes within your WordPress editor. A new button in your post editor will appear that will guide you through getting this code for your video(s).
1. View plugin settings under Settings > EmbedPlus.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of the shortcode that you can paste into your website. Note the editor button you can use to go through the wizard within your blog.
